## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

First install all required packages with:
```
npm install
```

You can run the app in development mode. In this mode, pages reload automatically when you make changes, and errors are displayed as they occur:
```
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, build the app in production mode to bundle the source files into the dist directory. This process optimizes and minifies the files for the best performance, making them ready for deployment:
```
npm run build
```
